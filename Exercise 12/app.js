// Question :
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
//  The text of each message should be the same,
//  but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const names = ["Sheheryar", "Aziz", "Wasiq"];
console.log(`${names[0]} is my friend`);
console.log(`${names[1]} is my friend`);
console.log(`${names[2]} is my friend`);
